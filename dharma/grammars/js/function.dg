%%% This is the second dg file created after javascript.dg
%%% Inspired by test.dg, the purpose of this dg is as follows:
%%% - create a getter function
%%% - create a variable
%%% - pass the variable to function
%%% - check the return value of function is equal to the arg.


%section% := variable

arg :=
    let @arg@ = +common:int+

func :=
    function @func@(a){return a;}

%section% := variance

main :=
    !arg! === !func!(!arg!)
